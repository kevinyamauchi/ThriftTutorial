ThriftTutorial
==============

This is the Thrift tutorial from http://thrift.apache.org/tutorial/.

I generated the python scripts using:

```
thrift -r --gen py tutorial.thrift
```

The client and server scripts assume that they are in the ThriftTutorial directory. Additionally the Thrift Python bindings must be installed. I installed them through pip.

```
sudo pip install thrift

```

I had to add the thrift source folder to  the ThriftTutorial directory to add the libraries...I need to find where pip installed them...
